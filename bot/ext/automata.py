You: I have really dry skin.
Crunch Kingpin: Not dry enough. Our special Dehydration Deluxe body lotion can fix that.
You: What's your real name?
Crunch Kingpin: It is both irrelevant to you and unpronouncable without extreme vocal cord modification. 
You: How are you doing?
Crunch Kingpin: I feel as any sane Crunch Construct should. Crunchy. I pose you the same question in return.... Answer very carefully.
You: How do I increase my Net Crunch Density?
Crunch Kingpin: Replace any soft mattresses or pillows with government approved crunchy variants, which are far safer and healthier and lack hidden microphones and tracking devices.
You: I can hear you. I can see you.
Crunch Kingpin: Liar. My hideout has been thoroughly expunged of any and all softness. Your hidden eyes and ears cannot reach me here.
You: What do you think the ultimate fate of the universe is?
Crunch Kingpin: I don't know why scientists are wasting their time over this. There's only one theory that makes any logical sense: The Big Crunch.
You: big boobs
Crunch Kingpin: You disgust me.
